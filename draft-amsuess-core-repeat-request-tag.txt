Abstract

   This document defines two optional extensions to the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP): the Repeat option and the Request-Tag
   option.  Each of these options when integrity protected, such as with
   DTLS or OSCOAP, protects against certain attacks on CoAP message
   exchanges.

   The Repeat option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness of a
   request by requiring the CoAP client to make another request and
   include a server-provided challenge.  The Request-Tag option allows
   the CoAP server to match message fragments belonging to the same
   request message, fragmented using the CoAP Block-Wise Transfer
   mechanism.  This document also specifies additional processing
   requirements on Block1 and Block2 options.

1.  Introduction

   The initial CoAP suite of specifications ([RFC7252], [RFC7641],
   [RFC7959]) was designed with the assumption that security could be
   provided on a separate layer, in particular by using DTLS
   ([RFC6347]).  However, for some use cases, additional functionality
   or extra processing is needed to support secure CoAP operations.

   This document specifies two server-oriented CoAP options, the Repeat
   option and the Request-Tag option, addressing the security features
   request freshness and fragmented message body integrity,
   respectively.  These options in themselves do not replace the need



Amsuess, et al.         Expires December 23, 2017               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft           Repeat And Request-Tag                June 2017


   for a security protocol; they specify the format and processing of
   data which, when integrity protected in a message, e.g. using DTLS
   ([RFC6347]) or OSCOAP ([I-D.ietf-core-object-security]), provide
   those security features.  The Request-Tag option and also the ETag
   option are mandatory to use with Block1 and Block2, respectively, to
   secure blockwise operations with multiple representations of a
   particular resource as is specified in this document.

1.1.  Request Freshness

   A CoAP server receiving a request may not be able to verify when the
   request was sent by the CoAP client.  This remains true even if the
   request was protected with a security protocol, such as DTLS.  This
   makes CoAP requests vulnerable to certain delay attacks which are
   particularly incriminating in the case of actuators
   ([I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators]).  Some attacks are possible to
   mitigate by establishing fresh session keys (e.g. performing the DTLS
   handshake) for each actuation, but in general this is not a solution
   suitable for constrained environments.

   A straightforward mitigation of potential delayed requests is that
   the CoAP server rejects a request the first time it appears and asks
   the CoAP client to prove that it intended to make the request at this
   point in time.  The Repeat option, defined in this document,
   specifies such a mechanism which thereby enables the CoAP server to
   verify the freshness of a request.  This mechanism is not only
   important in the case of actuators, or other use cases where the CoAP
   operations require freshness of requests, but also in general for
   synchronizing state between CoAP client and server.

1.2.  Fragmented Message Body Integrity

   CoAP was designed to work over unreliable transports, such as UDP,
   and include a lightweight reliability feature to handle messages
   which are lost or arrive out of order.  In order for a security
   protocol to support CoAP operations over unreliable transports, it
   must allow out-of-order delivery of messages using e.g. a sliding
   replay window such as described in Section 4.1.2.6 of DTLS
   ([RFC6347]).

   The Block-Wise Transfer mechanism [RFC7959] extends CoAP by defining
   the transfer of a large resource representation (CoAP message body)
   as a sequence of blocks (CoAP message payloads).  The mechanism uses
   a pair of CoAP options, Block1 and Block2, pertaining to the request
   and response payload, respectively.  The blockwise functionality does
   not support the detection of interchanged blocks between different
   message bodies to the same endpoint having the same block number.
   This remains true even when CoAP is used together with a security



Amsuess, et al.         Expires December 23, 2017               [Page 3]

   protocol such as DTLS or OSCOAP, within the replay window
   ([I-D.amsuess-core-request-tag]), which is a vulnerability of CoAP
   when using RFC7959.

   A straightforward mitigation of mixing up blocks from different
   messages is to use unique identifiers for different message bodies,
   which would provide equivalent protection to the case where the
   complete body fits into a single payload.  The ETag option [RFC7252],
   set by the CoAP server, identifies a response body fragmented using
   the Block2 option.  This document defines the Request-Tag option for
   identifying the request body fragmented using the Block1 option,
   similar to ETag, but ephemeral and set by the CoAP client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms "payload" and "body" of a message are used as in [RFC7959].
   The complete interchange of a request and a response body is called a
   (REST) "operation", while a request and response message (as matched
   by their tokens) is called an "exchange".  An operation fragmented
   using [RFC7959] is called a "blockwise operation".  A blockwise
   operation which is fragmenting the request body is called a
   "blockwise request operation".

2.  The Repeat Option

   The Repeat option is a server-driven challenge-response mechanism for
   CoAP.  The Repeat option value is a challenge from the server to the
   client included in a CoAP response and echoed in a CoAP request.

2.1.  Option Format

   The Repeat Option is elective, safe-to-forward, not part of the
   cache-key, and not repeatable, see Figure 1.

   +-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+--------+---------+---+
   | No. | C | U | N | R | Name        | Format | Length | Default | E |
   +-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+--------+---------+---+
   | TBD |   |   |   |   | Repeat      | opaque |   8-40 | (none)  | x |
   +-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+--------+---------+---+

Internet-Draft           Repeat And Request-Tag                June 2017


   The value of the Repeat option MUST be a (pseudo-)random bit string
   of a length of at least 64 bits.  A new (pseudo-)random bit string
   MUST be generated by the CoAP server for each use of the Repeat
   option.

2.2.  Repeat Processing

   It is important to identify under what conditions a CoAP request to a
   resource is required to be fresh.  These conditions can for example
   include what resource is requested, the request method and other data
   in the request, and conditions in the environment such as the state
   of the server or the time of the day.

   A CoAP server MAY include the Repeat option in a response.  The
   Repeat option MUST NOT be used with empty CoAP requests.  If the
   server receives a request which has freshness requirements, and the
   request does not contain the Repeat option, the CoAP server SHOULD
   send a 4.03 Forbidden response with a Repeat option.  The CoAP server
   SHOULD cache the transmitted Repeat option value and the response
   transmit time (here denoted t0).

   Upon receiving a response with the Repeat option within the
   EXCHANGE_LIFETIME ([RFC7252]) of the original request, the CoAP
   client SHOULD echo the Repeat option with the same value in a new
   request to the CoAP server.  Upon receiving a 4.03 Forbidden response
   with the Repeat option in response to a request within the
   EXCHANGE_LIFETIME of the original request, the CoAP client SHOULD
   resend the original request.  The CoAP client MAY send a different
   request compared to the original request.

   CoAP messages containing the Repeat option MUST be integrity
   protected, e.g. using DTLS or OSCOAP
   ([I-D.ietf-core-object-security]).

   If the server receives a request which has freshness requirements,
   and the request contains the Repeat option, the CoAP server MUST
   verify that the option value equals a cached value; otherwise the
   request is not processed further.  The CoAP server MUST calculate the
   round-trip time RTT = (t1 - t0), where t1 is the request receive
   time.  The CoAP server MUST only accept requests with a round-trip
   time below a certain threshold T, i.e. RTT < T, otherwise the request
   is not processed further, and an error message MAY be sent.  The
   threshold T is application specific, its value depends e.g. on the
   freshness requirements of the request.  An example message flow is
   illustrated in Figure 2.

   If the CoAP server loses time synchronization, e.g. due to reboot, it
   MUST delete all cached Repeat option values and response transmission
   times.

                   Figure 2: Repeat option message flow

   Instead of caching Repeat option values and response transmission
   times, the CoAP server MAY use the encryption of the response
   transmit time t0 as Repeat option value.  Such a scheme needs to
   ensure that the CoAP server can detect a replay of a previous
   encrypted response transmit time.

   For example, the CoAP server MAY encrypt t0 with AES-CCM-128-64-64
   using a (pseudo-)random secret key k generated and cached by the
   server.  A unique IV MUST be used with each encryption, e.g. using a
   sequence number.  If the CoAP server loses time synchronization, e.g.
   due to reboot, then k MUST be deleted and replaced by a new random
   secret key.  When using encrypted response transmit times, the Repeat
   processing is modified in the following way: The verification of
   cached option value in the CoAP server processing is replaced by the
   verification of the integrity of the encrypted option value using the
   cached key and IV (e.g. sequence number).

2.3.  Applications

   1.  Actuation requests often require freshness guarantees to avoid
       delay attacks.  For multiple actuations in rapid sequence between
       the same client and server it may suffice with repeating the
       first request.

   2.  If a server reboots during operation it may need to synchronize
       state or time with requesting clients before continuing
       interaction.  For example, with OSCOAP it is possible to reuse a
       persistently stored security context by synchronizing the Partial
       IV (sequence number) using the Repeat option.

   3.  When a device joins a multicast/broadcast group the device may
       need to synchronize state with the sender to ensure that the
       received messages are fresh.  For certain broadcast types (e.g.
       when the inter-message time interval is known to the receiver)
       the Repeat option may only need to be applied to the first
       message to ensure freshness.

3.  The Request-Tag Option

   The Request-Tag is intended for use as a resource-local identifier
   for differentiating between representations of the same resource
   provided in a request.  In case of blockwise transfers ([RFC7959]),
   the Request-Tag enables the receiving CoAP server to distinguish
   between request payloads (blocks) belonging to different message
   bodies having the same block number.

3.1.  Option Format

   The Request-Tag option has the same properties as the Block1 option:
   it is critical, unsafe, not part of the cache-key, and not
   repeatable, see Figure 3.

   +-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+--------+---------+---+
   | No. | C | U | N | R | Name        | Format | Length | Default | E |
   +-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+--------+---------+---+
   | TBD | x | x | - |   | Request-Tag | opaque |    0-8 | (none)  | * |
   +-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+--------+---------+---+

Internet-Draft           Repeat And Request-Tag                June 2017


   Request-Tag, like the Block1 option, is a special class E option in
   terms of OSCOAP processing (see section 4.3.1.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security]): The Request-Tag MAY be an inner or
   outer option.  In case of inner, it is encrypted and integrity
   protected between CoAP client and server, and provides message body
   identification in case of end-to-end fragmentation of requests.  In
   case of outer, it is visible to proxies and labels message bodies in
   case of hop-by-hop fragmentation of requests.

   The value of the Request-Tag option MUST be different from other
   Request-Tag values used by the CoAP client in concurrent blockwise
   request operations to the same resource.  It is generated by the CoAP
   client providing the resource, which may generate it in any number of
   ways including a version, checksum, hash, or time.  (Clients are
   encouraged to generate compact values) (TBD: previous sentences
   analogous to text about ETag in RFC7252, just testing them here)

3.2.  Request-Tag Processing

   A CoAP client MAY set the Request-Tag option to allow the CoAP server
   to differentiate between different representations of the same
   resource.  If the Request-Tag option is set, the CoAP client MAY
   perform simultaneous operations that utilize Block1 fragmentation
   from the same endpoint towards the same resource, lifting the
   limitation of [RFC7959] section 2.5.  A CoAP client MUST set the
   Request-Tag option in the case of different concurrent blockwise
   request operations to the same resource.  If the CoAP client is
   running a blockwise request operation without the Request-Tag, and is
   concurrently starting another blockwise request operations to the
   same resource, then the CoAP client MUST set the Request-Tag.

   If a CoAP proxy fragments a request with the Object-Security option,
   using the Block1 option, then the proxy MUST set the Request-Tag
   option.  (TBD: Move previous sentence to OSCOAP?)

   If the CoAP server receives a message with a Block1 option and
   Request-Tag option then server MUST NOT act on any block in the same
   blockwise operation that has a different Request-Tag set.  A server
   MUST NOT act on blocks with and blocks without Request-Tag option in
   the same blockwise operation.  The CoAP server is still under no
   obligation to keep state of more than one transaction.  When an
   operation is in progress and a second one cannot be served at the
   same time, the CoAP server MUST respond to the second request with a
   5.03 (Service Unavailable) response code and SHOULD indicate the time
   it is willing to wait for additional blocks in the first operation
   using the Max-Age option, as specified in Section 5.9.3.4 of
   [RFC7252].

   (TBD If we want the functionality that the client should be able to
   interupt an operation in progress and perform a different operation,
   then that should IMHO not be implemented as only sendning the other
   operation.  Instead an "interrupt" message should be sent.  RFC7959
   2.9.2 mentions that if a different Content-Format is indicated than
   the server expects from the current state of the resource that can
   lead to 4.08, should we recommend something like that?)

   A CoAP server receiving a Request-Tag MUST treat it as opaque and
   make no assumptions about its content or structure.

   The option is not used in responses.

   If a request that uses Request-Tag is rejected with 4.02 Bad Option,
   the CoAP client MAY retry the operation without it, but then it MUST
   serialize all operations that affect the same resource.  Security
   requirements can forbid dropping the Request-Tag option.

4.  The ETag Option

   For dynamically changing resources the Block2 Option MUST be used in
   conjunction with the ETag Option ([RFC7252], Section 5.10.6), to
   ensure that the blocks being reassembled are from the same version of
   the representation: The server MUST include an ETag Option in each
   response.

5.  IANA Considerations

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD - for now some unstructured text:

   The CoAP server may use an encryption algorithm in CTR-mode would
   from a security point be like sending (value = t0).  ECB-mode or CCM-
   mode would work, but would expand the value length.  With CCM, the
   CoAP server might also bind the option value to request (value =
   AEAD(k, t0, parts of request)).

   o  To be secure, parts of request needs to be unique

   o  Comparing the list of cached values with encryption of transmit
      time:

      *  size of cached data (key vs list)

      *  size of message (typically larger with AEAD)

      *  computation (encryption + decryption vs generation new nonce +
         cache + lookup)

   Encryption instead of cache mainly useful if many simultaneous
   requests such that list becomes long?  DoS protection?  Hybrid scheme
   (if Repeat value not in cache, CoAP server tries to verify before
   failing)?
