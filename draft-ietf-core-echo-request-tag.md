--- abstract

This document specifies security enhancements to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Two optional extensions are defined: the Echo option and the Request-Tag option. Each of these options provide additional features to CoAP and protects against certain attacks. The document also updates the processing requirements on the Token of {{RFC7252}}. The updated Token processing ensures secure binding of responses to requests.

# Introduction {#intro}

The initial Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) suite of specifications ({{RFC7252}}, {{RFC7641}}, and {{RFC7959}}) was designed with the assumption that security could be provided on a separate layer, in particular by using DTLS ({{RFC6347}}). However, for some use cases, additional functionality or extra processing is needed to support secure CoAP operations. This document specifies several security enhancements to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).

This document specifies two server-oriented CoAP options, the Echo option and the Request-Tag option: The Echo option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness of a request, verify the aliveness of a client, synchronize state, or force a client to demonstrate reachability at its apparent network address. The Request-Tag option allows the CoAP server to match message fragments belonging to the same request, fragmented using the CoAP Block-Wise Transfer mechanism, which mitigates attacks and enables concurrent blockwise operations. These options in themselves do not replace the need for a security protocol; they specify the format and processing of data which, when integrity protected using e.g. DTLS ({{RFC6347}}), TLS ({{RFC8446}}), or OSCORE ({{I-D.ietf-core-object-security}}), provide the additional security features.

The document also updates the processing requirements on the Token. The updated processing ensures secure binding of responses to requests.


## Request Freshness {#req-fresh}

A CoAP server receiving a request is in general not able to verify when the request was sent by the CoAP client. This remains true even if the request was protected with a security protocol, such as DTLS. This makes CoAP requests vulnerable to certain delay attacks which are particularly incriminating in the case of actuators ({{I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators}}). Some attacks are possible to mitigate by establishing fresh session keys (e.g. performing a DTLS handshake) for each actuation, but in general this is not a solution suitable for constrained environments, for example, due to increased message overhead and latency. Additionally, if security is not end-to-end with the client originating the request, e.g. DTLS between the server and a proxy, then performing a handshake does not provide additional information about the client. 

A straightforward mitigation of potential delayed requests is that the CoAP server rejects a request the first time it appears and asks the CoAP client to prove that it intended to make the request at this point in time. The Echo option, defined in this document, specifies such a mechanism which thereby enables the CoAP server to verify the freshness of a request. This mechanism is not only important in the case of actuators, or other use cases where the CoAP operations require freshness of requests, but also in general for synchronizing state between CoAP client and server and to verify aliveness of the client.


## Fragmented Message Body Integrity {#body-int}

CoAP was designed to work over unreliable transports, such as UDP, and include a lightweight reliability feature to handle messages which are lost or arrive out of order. In order for a security protocol to support CoAP operations over unreliable transports, it must allow out-of-order delivery of messages using e.g. a sliding replay window such as described in Section 4.1.2.6 of DTLS ({{RFC6347}}).

The Block-Wise Transfer mechanism {{RFC7959}} extends CoAP by defining the transfer of a large resource representation (CoAP message body) as a sequence of blocks (CoAP message payloads). The mechanism uses a pair of CoAP options, Block1 and Block2, pertaining to the request and response payload, respectively. The blockwise functionality does not support the detection of interchanged blocks between different message bodies to the same resource having the same block number. This remains true even when CoAP is used together with a security protocol such as DTLS or OSCORE, within the replay window ({{I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators}}), which is a vulnerability of CoAP when using RFC7959.

A straightforward mitigation of mixing up blocks from different messages is to use unique identifiers for different message bodies, which would provide equivalent protection to the case where the complete body fits into a single payload. The ETag option {{RFC7252}}, set by the CoAP server, identifies a response body fragmented using the Block2 option. This document defines the Request-Tag option for identifying the request body fragmented using the Block1 option, similar to ETag, but ephemeral and set by the CoAP client.

## Request-Response Binding

A fundamental requirement of secure REST operations is that the client can bind a response to a particular request. If this is not valid a client may otherwise erroneously associate the wrong response to a request, the wrong response may be an old response for the same resource or for a completely different resource (see e.g. Section 2.3 of {{I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators}}). For example a request for the alarm status "GET /status" may be associated to a prior response "on", instead of the correct response "off".  

In HTTPS, binding is assured by the ordered and reliable delivery as well as mandating that the server sends responses in the same order that the requests were received. The same is not true for CoAP where the server (or an attacker) can return responses in any order. Concurrent requests are instead differentiated by their Token. Note that the CoAP Message ID cannot be used for this purpose since those are typically different for REST request and corresponding response in case of "separate response", see Section 2.2 of {{RFC7252}}.

Unfortunately, CoAP {{RFC7252}} does not treat Token as a cryptographically important value and does not give stricter guidelines than that the tokens currently "in use" SHOULD (not SHALL) be unique. If used with security protocol not providing bindings between requests and responses (e.g. DTLS and TLS) token reuse may result in situations where a client matches a response to the wrong request. Note that mismatches can also happen for other reasons than a malicious attacker, e.g. delayed delivery or a server sending notifications to an uninterested client.

A straightforward mitigation is to mandate clients to never reuse tokens until the traffic keys have been replaced. As there may be any number of responses to a request (see e.g. {{RFC7641}}), the easiest way to accomplish this is to implement the token as a counter and never reuse any tokens at all. This document updates the Token processing in {{RFC7252}} to always assure a cryptographically secure binding of responses to requests.


## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Unless otherwise specified, the terms "client" and "server" refers to "CoAP client" and "CoAP server", respectively, as defined in {{RFC7252}}.

The terms "payload" and "body" of a message are used as in {{RFC7959}}.  The complete interchange of a request and a response body is called a (REST) "operation". An operation fragmented using {{RFC7959}} is called a "blockwise operation". A blockwise operation which is fragmenting the request body is called a "blockwise request operation".  A blockwise operation which is fragmenting the response body is called a "blockwise response operation".

Two request messages are said to be "matchable" if they occur between the same endpoint pair, have the same code and the same set of options except for elective NoCacheKey options and options involved in block-wise transfer (Block1, Block2 and Request-Tag).
<!-- We could also keep the Request-Tag inside the matchable criterion, but then we'd be saying "matchable except for the Request-Tag" all over the document. -->
Two operations are said to be matchable if any of their messages are.

Two matchable blockwise operations are said to be "concurrent" if a block of the second request is exchanged even though the client still intends to exchange further blocks in the first operation. (Concurrent blockwise request operations are impossible with the options of {{RFC7959}} because the second operation's block overwrites any state of the first exchange.).

The Echo and Request-Tag options are defined in this document.



# The Echo Option {#echo}

The Echo option is a server-driven challenge-response mechanism for CoAP. The Echo option value is a challenge from the server to the client included in a CoAP response and echoed in one or more CoAP request.

## Option Format {#echo-format}

The Echo Option is elective, safe-to-forward, not part of the cache-key, and not repeatable, see {{echo-table}}, which extends Table of {{RFC7252}}).

      C = Critical, U = Unsafe, N = NoCacheKey, R = Repeatable,
      E = Encrypt and Integrity Protect (when using OSCORE)
~~~~~~~~~~
{: #echo-table title="Echo Option Summary" artwork-align="center"}

[ Note to RFC editor: If this document is released before core-object-security, then the following paragraph and the "E"/"U" columns above need to move into core-object-security, as they are defined in that draft. ]

Echo is a class E option, meaning that when OSCORE is used it is encrypted and integrity protected such that only the parties sharing the security context can read the plaintext value.

The Echo option value is generated by the server, and its content and structure are implementation specific. Different methods for generating Echo option values are outlined in {{echo-state}}. Clients and intermediaries MUST treat an Echo option value as opaque and make no assumptions about its content or structure.

When receiving an Echo option in a request, the server MUST be able to verify that the Echo option value was generated by the server as well as the point in time when the Echo option value was generated.

## Echo Processing

The Echo option MAY be included in any request or response (see {{echo-app}} for different applications), but the Echo option MUST NOT be used with empty CoAP requests (i.e. Code=0.00).

If the server receives a request which has freshness requirements, the request does not contain a fresh Echo option value, and the server cannot verify the freshness of the request in some other way, the server MUST NOT process the request further and SHOULD send a 4.01 Unauthorized response with an Echo option. The server MAY include the same Echo option value in several different responses and to different clients.

The application decides under what conditions a CoAP request to a resource is required to be fresh. These conditions can for example include what resource is requested, the request method and other data in the request, and conditions in the environment such as the state of the server or the time of the day.

The server may also include the Echo option in a response to verify the aliveness of a client, to synchronize state, or to force a client to demonstrate reachability at their apparent network address.

Upon receiving a 4.01 Unauthorized response with the Echo option, the client SHOULD resend the original request with the addition of an Echo option with the received Echo option value. The client MAY send a different request compared to the original request. Upon receiving any other response with the Echo option, the client SHOULD echo the Echo option value in the next request to the server. The client MAY include the same Echo option value in several different requests to the server.

Upon receiving a request with the Echo option, the server determines if the request has freshness requirements. If the request does not have freshness requirements, the Echo option MAY be ignored. If the request has freshness requirements and the server cannot verify the freshness of the request in some other way, the server MUST verify that the Echo option value was generated by the server; otherwise the request is not processed further. The server MUST then calculate the round-trip time RTT = (t1 - t0), where t1 is the request receive time and t0 is the time when the Echo option value was generated. The server MUST only accept requests with a round-trip time below a certain threshold T, i.e. RTT < T. If the server cannot verify that the Echo option value was generated by the server or the round-trip time is not below the threshold the request is not processed further, and an error message MAY be sent. The error message SHOULD include a new Echo option. The threshold T is application specific, its value depends e.g. on the freshness requirements of the request. An example message flow is illustrated in {{echo-figure}}.

{: #echo-figure title="Example Echo Option Message Flow" artwork-align="center"}

When used to serve freshness requirements (including client aliveness and state synchronizing), CoAP requests containing the Echo option MUST be integrity protected, e.g. using DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE ({{I-D.ietf-core-object-security}}), in which case it will also be encrypted. When used to demonstrate reachability at their apparent network address, the Echo option MAY be used without protection.

Note that the server does not have to synchronize the time used for the Echo timestamps with any other party. However, if the server loses time continuity, e.g. due to reboot, it MUST reject all Echo values that was created before time continuity was lost.

CoAP-to-CoAP proxies MUST relay the Echo option unmodified. The CoAP server side of CoAP-to-HTTP proxies MAY request freshness, especially if they have reason to assume that access may require it (e.g. because it is a PUT or POST); how this is determined is out of scope for this document. The CoAP client side of HTTP-to-CoAP proxies SHOULD respond to Echo challenges themselves if they know from the recent establishing of the connection that the HTTP request is fresh. Otherwise, they SHOULD respond with 503 Service Unavailable, Retry-After: 0 and terminate any underlying Keep-Alive connection. They MAY also use other mechanisms to establish freshness of the HTTP request that are not specified here.


## Applications {#echo-app}

1. Actuation requests often require freshness guarantees to avoid accidental or malicious delayed actuator actions. In general, all non-safe methods (e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE) may require freshness guarantees for secure operation.

    * To avoid additional roundtrips for applications with multiple actuator requests in rapid sequence between the same client and server, the server may use the Echo option (with a new value) in response to a request containing the Echo option. The client then uses the Echo option with the new value in the next actuation request, and the server compares the receive time accordingly.

2. A server may use the Echo option to synchronize state or time with a requesting client. A server MUST NOT synchronize state or time with clients which are not the authority of the property being synchronized. E.g. if access to a server resource is dependent on time, then the client MUST NOT set the time of the server.

    * If a server reboots during operation it may need to synchronize state or time before continuing the interaction. For example, with OSCORE it is possible to reuse a partly persistently stored security context by synchronizing the Partial IV (sequence number) using the Echo option, see Section 7.5 of {{I-D.ietf-core-object-security}}.

    * A device joining a CoAP group communication {{RFC7390}} may be required to initially verify freshness and synchronize state or time with the client using the Echo option in a unicast response to a multicast request. The client reciving the response with the Echo option includes the Echo option with the same value in a request, either in a unicast request to the responding server, or in a subsequent group message. In the latter case, the Echo option will be ignored expect by responding server.


3. A server that sends large responses to unauthenticated peers SHOULD mitigate amplification attacks such as described in Section 11.3 of {{RFC7252}} (where an attacker would put a victim's address in the source address of a CoAP request). For this purpose, the server MAY ask a client to Echo its request to verify its source address. This needs to be done only once per peer and limits the range of potential victims from the general Internet to endpoints that have been previously in contact with the server. For this application, the Echo option can be used in messages that are not integrity protected, for example during discovery.

4. A server may want to verify the aliveness of a client by responding with an Echo option.


# The Request-Tag Option # {#request-tag}

The Request-Tag is intended for use as a short-lived identifier for keeping apart distinct blockwise request operations on one resource from one client. It enables the receiving server to reliably assemble request payloads (blocks) to their message bodies, and, if it chooses to support it, to reliably process simultaneous blockwise request operations on a single resource. The requests must be integrity protected in order to protect against interchange of blocks between different message bodies.

In essence, it is an implementation of the "proxy-safe elective option" used just to "vary the cache key" as suggested in {{RFC7959}} Section 2.4.


## Option Format ## {#req-tag-format}

The Request-Tag option is not critical, is safe to forward, repeatable, and part of the cache key, see {{req-tag-table}}, which extends Table 4 of {{RFC7252}}).

~~~~~~~~~~
+-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+------+---------+---+---+
| No. | C | U | N | R | Name        | Format | Len. | Default | E | U |
+-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+------+---------+---+---+
| TBD |   |   |   | x | Request-Tag | opaque |  0-8 | (none)  | x | x |
+-----+---+---+---+---+-------------+--------+------+---------+---+---+

      C = Critical, U = Unsafe, N = NoCacheKey, R = Repeatable,
      E = Encrypt and Integrity Protect (when using OSCORE)
~~~~~~~~~~
{: #req-tag-table title="Request-Tag Option Summary" artwork-align="center"}

[ Note to RFC editor: If this document is released before core-object-security, then the following paragraph and the "E"/"U" columns above need to move into core-object-security, as they are defined in that draft. ]

Request-Tag, like the block options, is both a class E and a class U option in terms of OSCORE processing (see Section 4.1 of {{I-D.ietf-core-object-security}}): The Request-Tag MAY be an inner or outer option. It influences the inner or outer block operation, respectively. The inner and outer values are therefore independent of each other. The inner option is encrypted and integrity protected between client and server, and provides message body identification in case of end-to-end fragmentation of requests. The outer option is visible to proxies and labels message bodies in case of hop-by-hop fragmentation of requests.

The Request-Tag option is only used in the request messages of blockwise operations.

The Request-Tag mechanism can be applied independently on the server and client sides of CoAP-to-CoAP proxies as are the block options,
though given it is safe to forward, a proxy is free to just forward it when processing an operation.
CoAP-to-HTTP proxies and HTTP-to-CoAP proxies can use Request-Tag on their CoAP sides;
it is not applicable to HTTP requests.

## Request-Tag Processing by Servers ## {#request-tag-processing}

The Request-Tag option does not require any particular processing on the server side
outside of the processing already necessary for any unknown elective proxy-safe cache-key option:
The option varies the properties that distinguish blockwise operations
(which includes all options except elective NoCacheKey and except Block1/2),
and thus the server can not treat messages with a different list of Request-Tag options as belonging to the same operation.
<!-- not speaking of "matchable" here as that working definition explicitly excludes Request-Tag to make the rest of the document easier to read -->

To keep utilizing the cache,
a server (including proxies) MAY discard the Request-Tag option
from an assembled block-wise request when consulting its cache,
as the option relates to the operation-on-the-wire and not its semantics.
For example, a FETCH request with the same body as an older one can be served from the cache if the older's Max-Age has not expired yet,
even if the second operation uses a Request-Tag and the first did not.
(This is similar to the situation about ETag in that it is formally part of the cache key,
but implementations that are aware of its meaning can cache more efficiently,
see {{RFC7252}} Section 5.4.2).

A server receiving a Request-Tag MUST treat it as opaque and make no assumptions about its content or structure.

Two messages carrying the same Request-Tag is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being part of the same operation.
They can still be treated as independent messages by the server (e.g. when it sends 2.01/2.04 responses for every block),
or initiate a new operation (overwriting kept context) when the later message carries Block1 number 0.

As it has always been,
a server that can only serve a limited number of block-wise operations at the same time
can delay the start of the operation by replying with 5.03 (Service unavailable) and a Max-Age indicating how long it expects the existing operation to go on,
or it can forget about the state established with the older operation and respond with 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) to later blocks on the first operation.

## Setting the Request-Tag

For each separate blockwise request operation, the client can choose a Request-Tag value, or choose not to set a Request-Tag.
Starting a request operation matchable to a
previous operation and even using the same Request-Tag value is called request tag recycling.
The absence of a Request-Tag option is viewed as a value distinct from all values with a single Request-Tag option set;
starting a request operation matchable to a previous operation where neither has a Request-Tag option
therefore constitutes request tag recycling just as well
(also called "recycling the absent option").

Clients MUST NOT recycle a request tag unless the first operation has concluded.
What constitutes a concluded operation depends on the application, and is outlined individually in {{req-tag-applications}}.

When Block1 and Block2 are combined in an operation,
the Request-Tag of the Block1 phase is set in the Block2 phase as well
for otherwise the request would have a different set of options
and would not be recognized any more.

Clients are encouraged to generate compact messages. This means sending messages without Request-Tag options whenever possible, and using short values when the absent option can not be recycled.

## Applications {#req-tag-applications}


### Body Integrity Based on Payload Integrity {#body-integrity}

When a client fragments a request body into multiple message payloads, even if the individual messages are integrity protected, it is still possible for a man-in-the-middle to maliciously replace a later operation's blocks with an earlier operation's blocks (see Section 2.5 of {{I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators}}). Therefore, the integrity protection of each block does not extend to the operation's request body.

In order to gain that protection, use the Request-Tag mechanism as follows:

* The individual exchanges MUST be integrity protected end-to-end between client and server.

* The client MUST NOT recycle a request tag in a new operation unless the <!-- or "all", but by this rule there can only be one --> previous operation matchable to the new one has concluded.

  If any future security mechanisms allow a block-wise transfer to continue
  after an endpoint's details (like the IP address) has changed, then
  the client MUST consider messages sent to *any* endpoint with the new operation's security context.

* The client MUST NOT regard a blockwise request operation as concluded unless all of the messages the client previously sent in the operation have been confirmed by the message integrity protection mechanism, or are considered invalid by the server if replayed.

  Typically, in OSCORE, these confirmations can result either from the client receiving an OSCORE response message matching the request (an empty ACK is insufficient), or because the message's sequence number is old enough to be outside the server's receive window.

  In DTLS, this can only be confirmed if the request message was not retransmitted, and was responded to.

<!-- pending see thread "ERT and OSCORE" -->
Authors of other documents (e.g. {{I-D.ietf-core-object-security}}) are invited to mandate this behavior for clients that execute blockwise interactions over secured transports. In this way, the server can rely on a conforming client to set the Request-Tag option when required, and thereby conclude on the integrity of the assembled body.

Note that this mechanism is implicitly implemented when the security layer guarantees ordered delivery (e.g. CoAP over TLS {{RFC8323}}). This is because with each message, any earlier message can not be replayed any more, so the client never needs to set the Request-Tag option unless it wants to perform concurrent operations.

### Multiple Concurrent Blockwise Operations

CoAP clients, especially CoAP proxies, may initiate a blockwise request operation to a resource, to which a previous one is already in progress, which the new request should not cancel.
A CoAP proxy would be in such a situation when it forwards operations with the same cache-key options but possibly different payloads.

For those cases, Request-Tag is the proxy-safe elective option suggested in {{RFC7959}} Section 2.4 last paragraph.

When initializing a new blockwise operation, a client has to look at other active operations:

* If any of them is matchable to the new one, and the client neither wants to cancel the old one nor postpone the new one,
it can pick a Request-Tag value that is not in use by the other matchable operations for the new operation.

* Otherwise, it can start the new operation without setting the Request-Tag option on it.

### Simplified Block-Wise Handling for Constrained Proxies

The Block options were defined to be unsafe to forward
because a proxy that would forward blocks as plain messages would risk mixing up clients' requests.

The Request-Tag option provides a very simple way for a proxy to keep them separate:
if it appends a Request-Tag that is particular to the requesting endpoint
to all request carrying any Block option,
it does not need to keep track of any further block state.

This is particularly useful to proxies that strive for stateless operation
as described in {{?I-D.hartke-core-stateless}} Section 3.1.


## Rationale for the Option Properties

The Request-Tag option can be elective, because to servers unaware of the Request-Tag option, operations with differing request tags will not be matchable.

The Request-Tag option can be safe to forward but part of the cache key, because to proxies unaware of the Request-Tag option will consider operations with differing request tags unmatchable but can still forward them.

The Request-Tag option is repeatable
because this easily allows stateless proxies to "chain" their origin address.
Were it a single option, they would need to employ some length/value scheme to avoid confusing
requests without a Request-Tag option with requests that carry a zero-length request tag.

In earlier versions of this draft, the Request-Tag option used to be critical and unsafe to forward.
That design was based on an erroneous understanding of which blocks could be composed according to {{RFC7959}}.

## Rationale for Introducing the Option

An alternative that was considered to the Request-Tag option
for coping with the problem of fragmented message body integrity ({{body-integrity}})
was to update {{RFC7959}} to say that blocks could only be assembled
if their fragments' order corresponded to the sequence numbers.

That approach would have been difficult to roll out reliably on DTLS
where many implementations do not expose sequence numbers,
and would still not prevent attacks like in {{I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators}} Section 2.5.2.

# Block2 / ETag Processing # {#etag}

The same security properties as in {{body-integrity}} can be obtained for blockwise response operations.
The threat model here is not an attacker (because the response is made sure to belong to the current request by the security layer),
but blocks in the client's cache.

Rules stating that response body reassembly is conditional on matching ETag values are already in place from Section 2.4 of {{RFC7959}}.

To gain equivalent protection to {{body-integrity}},
a server MUST use the Block2 option in conjunction with the ETag option ({{RFC7252}}, Section 5.10.6),
and MUST NOT use the same ETag value for different representations of a resource.

# Token Processing {#token}

This section updates the Token processing in Section 5.3.1 of {{RFC7252}} by adding the following text:

When CoAP is used with a security protocol not providing bindings between requests and responses, the client MUST NOT reuse tokens until the traffic keys have been replaced. The easiest way to accomplish this is to implement the Token as a counter, this approach SHOULD be followed.

# Security Considerations {#sec-cons}

Implementations SHOULD NOT put any privacy sensitive information in the Echo or Request-Tag option values. Unencrypted timestamps MAY reveal information about the server such as its wall clock time or location. Servers MUST use a monotonic clock to generate timestamps and compute round-trip times. Servers SHOULD NOT use wall clock time for timestamps, as wall clock time is not monotonic, may reveal that the server will accept expired certificates, or reveal the server's location. Use of non-monotonic clocks is not secure as the server will accept expired Echo option values if the clock is moved backward. The server will also reject fresh Echo option values if the clock is moved forward. An attacker may be able to affect the server's wall clock time in various ways such as setting up a fake NTP server or broadcasting false time signals to radio-controlled clocks. Servers MAY use the time since reboot measured in some unit of time. Servers MAY reset the timer periodically. When resetting the timer, the server MUST reject all Echo values that was created before the reset.

The availability of a secure pseudorandom number generator and truly random seeds are essential for the security of the Echo option. If no true random number generator is available, a truly random seed must be provided from an external source.

An Echo value with 64 (pseudo-)random bits gives the same theoretical security level against forgeries as a 64-bit MAC (as used in e.g. AES_128_CCM_8). In practice, forgery of an Echo option value is much harder as an attacker must also forge the MAC in the security protocol. The Echo option value MUST contain 32 (pseudo-)random bits that are not predictable for any other party than the server, and SHOULD contain 64 (pseudo-)random bits. A server MAY use different security levels for different uses cases (client aliveness, request freshness, state synchronization, network address reachability, etc.).

The security provided by the Echo and Request-Tag options depends on the security protocol used. CoAP and HTTP proxies require (D)TLS to be terminated at the proxies. The proxies are therefore able to manipulate, inject, delete, or reorder options or packets. The security claims in such architectures only hold under the assumption that all intermediaries are fully trusted and have not been compromised.

Servers that use the List of Cached Random Values and Timestamps method described in {{echo-state}} may be vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks. On way to minimizing state is to use the Integrity Protected Timestamp  method described in {{echo-state}}.

# Methods for Generating Echo Option Values {#echo-state}

The content and structure of the Echo option value are implementation specific and determined by the server. Use of one of the mechanisms outlined in this section is RECOMMENDED.

Different mechanisms have different tradeoffs between the size of the Echo option value, the amount of server state, the amount of computation, and the security properties offered.

- Integrity Protected Timestamp. One method is to construct the Echo option value as an integrity protected timestamp. The timestamp can have different resolution and range. A 32-bit timestamp can e.g. give a resolution of 1 second with a range of 136 years. The (pseudo-)random secret key is generated by the server and not shared with any other party. The use of truncated HMAC-SHA-256 is RECOMMENDED. With a 32-bit timestamp and a 64-bit MAC, the size of the Echo option value is 12 bytes and the Server state is small and constant. If the server loses time continuity, e.g. due to reboot, the old key MUST be deleted and replaced by a new random secret key. A server MAY also want to encrypt its timestamps, depending on the choice of encryption algorithms, this may require a nonce to be included in the Echo option value.

~~~~~~~~~~
      Echo option value: timestamp t0, MAC(k, t0)
      Server State: secret key k
~~~~~~~~~~

- List of Cached Random Values and Timestamps. An alternative method is to construct the Echo option value as a (pseudo-)random byte string. The server caches a list containing the random byte strings and their transmission times. Assuming 64-bit random values and 32-bit timestamps, the size of the Echo option value is 8 bytes and the amount of server state is 12n bytes, where n is the number of active Echo Option values. If the server loses time continuity, e.g. due to reboot, the entries in the old list MUST be deleted.

~~~~~~~~~~
      Echo option value: random value r
      Server State: random value r, timestamp t0
~~~~~~~~~~

A server MAY use different methods and security levels for different uses cases (client aliveness, request freshness, state synchronization, network address reachability, etc.).

# Request-Tag Message Size Impact

In absence of concurrent operations, the Request-Tag mechanism for body integrity ({{body-integrity}}) incurs no overhead if no messages are lost (more precisely: in OSCORE, if no operations are aborted due to repeated transmission failure; in DTLS, if no packages are lost),
or when blockwise request operations happen rarely (in OSCORE, if there is always only one request blockwise operation in the replay window).

In those situations, no message has any Request-Tag option set, and that can be recycled indefinitely.

When the absence of a Request-Tag option can not be recycled any more within a security context, the messages with a present but empty Request-Tag option can be used (1 Byte overhead), and when that is used-up, 256 values from one byte long options (2 Bytes overhead) are available.

In situations where those overheads are unacceptable (e.g. because the payloads are known to be at a fragmentation threshold), the absent Request-Tag value can be made usable again:

* In DTLS, a new session can be established.
* In OSCORE, the sequence number can be artificially increased so that all lost messages are outside of the replay window by the time the first request of the new operation gets processed, and all earlier operations can therefore be regarded as concluded.

# Change Log

\[ The editor is asked to remove this section before publication. \]

* Major changes since draft-ietf-core-echo-request-tag-01:

    * Follow-up changes after the "relying on blockwise" change in -01:

        * Simplify the description of Request-Tag and matchability
        * Do not update RFC7959 any more

    * Make Request-Tag repeatable.
    * Add rationale on not relying purely on sequence numbers.

* Major changes since draft-ietf-core-echo-request-tag-00:
    * Reworded the Echo section.
    * Added rules for Token processing.
    * Added security considerations.
    * Added actual IANA section.
    * Made Request-Tag optional and safe-to-forward, relying on blockwise to treat it as part of the cache-key
    * Dropped use case about OSCORE outer-blockwise (the case went away when its Partial IV was moved into the Object-Security option)

* Major changes since draft-amsuess-core-repeat-request-tag-00:
    * The option used for establishing freshness was renamed from "Repeat" to "Echo" to reduce confusion about repeatable options.
    * The response code that goes with Echo was changed from 4.03 to 4.01 because the client needs to provide better credentials.
    * The interaction between the new option and (cross) proxies is now covered.
    * Two messages being "Request-Tag matchable" was introduced to replace the older concept of having a request tag value with its slightly awkward equivalence definition.
